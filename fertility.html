                    	<li class="blue_title">What is "Ovulation induction" and what you can make use of it?</li>
                        <li>It is the stimulation of ovulation by medication. It is used to reverse anovulation (anovulatory menstrual cycle ~when ovaries do not release an oocyte) and oligoovulation (infrequent or irregular ovulation)</li>
                        <li>Can be used in females having polycystic ovarian syndromes (PCOS) and pituitary disorders</li>
                        <li>These medications also control the time when female release the eggs, so sexual intercourse, intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization procedures can be scheduled at most appropriate time</li>
                        <li>The medication which is mostly used to treat anovulation is Clomiphene citrate which is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Other medications used are gonadotropins, metformin and parlodel</li>
                        <li>Some form of monitoring is necessary while taking clomiphene citrate. This monitoring includes ultrasounds, estrogen levels and urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) testing</li><br/>
                        
                        <li class="blue_title">How is ovulation induction done?</li>
                        <li>There are different levels of ovulation induction commonly used to treat infertility related to ovulation disorders, male factor or unknown causes</li>
                        <li>Clomiphene citrate is taken orally, on specific days of your menstrual cycle. It is typically on through Days 3 to 7 or through Days 5 to 9. It is sometimes paired with Provera, a medication that can help to induce menstruation. The initial dose of Clomiphene citrate is taken immediately after the menstrual period begins. This dose is typically around 50 milligrams, although it can be increased if ovulation does not occur</li>
                        <li>After ovulation begins the reproductive endocrinologist will monitor your ovulation. When the egg is released the female and male partners will engage in timed intercourse to increase chances of conception</li>
                        <li>Clomiphene may be combined with intrauterine insemination to boost the success of the medication</li><br/>
                        <li class="blue_title">Clomiphene success rate:</li>
                        <li>50-80% females respond by ovulating, but this does not necessarily mean pregnancy will be achieved</li>
                        <li>Pregnancy rates are typically 10-15% per cycle, however it depends on the type of fertility procedure the couple use</li>

                        <li>This is a deliberate introduction of semen into female's vagina or oviduct for the purpose of achieving fertilization</li>
                        <li>The sperm are placed directly into uterine cavity through catheter near ovulation.</li>
                        <li>This is helpful in conditions like low sperm count, sperm immobility in male partner</li>
                        <li>IUI is used in situations associated where male partner is unable to ejaculate within the female's vagina due to impotence, premature ejaculation and other medical conditions</li>
                        <li>IUI can overcome instances where female's immune system rejects male partner's sperm</li>
                        <li>Women with issues specific to cervix such as cervical scarring, cervical blockage from endometriosis or thick cervical mucus also benefit by this process</li>
                        <li>IUI can be performed with partner's sperm or donor sperm</li><br/>
                        
                        <li class="blue_title">Process of IUI</li>
                        <li>The female is usually given medications to stimulate development of multiple eggs and the insemination procedure is timed to coincide with the ovulation release of eggs</li>
                        <li>The male provides semen sample two to three hours before the procedure.</li>
                        <li>A semen specimen is either produced at home or in the office by masturbation after 2-5 days of abstinence from ejaculation</li>
                        <li>The sample is stored in a plastic cup, with donor's name/ID and recipient partner name/ID written on it</li>
                        <li>The semen sample is washed (sperm processing) to concentrate sperms and remove it from other components of semen. This process takes around 30-60 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Lastly, insemination is done. Doctor inserts a small catheter into female's uterine cavity through cervix and sperm is injected directly into the uterus</li>
                        <li>If the pregnancy does not occur then the procedure may be repeated during the following cycles</li><br/>
                        
                        <li class="blue_title">Success Rates:</li>
                        <li>The success rates vary amongst different couples, as success rate is dependent on different factors like female's health, age</li>
                        <li>Generally the success rate is 15%-20% per menstrual cycle and 60-70% couples achieve pregnancy after 6 cycles</li><br/>
                        
                        <li class="blue_title">Risks:</li>
                        <li>The major risk of IUI is that of multiple pregnancies. Since the patient is being superovulated, more than one egg may get fertilized, resulting in twins or even triplets or quadruplets</li>
                        <li>Infection may occur in uterus and tubes with bacterial contamination (semen sample or contamination of sterile catheter in vagina during the process)</li>
                        <li>Careful cleaning of cervix and cautious technique brings down the chances of infection to very rare</li>

                        <li>The male partner provides semen sample, from which the healthiest sperm will be extracted ( if no sperms are available naturally then the physician may use sperm retrieval procedures like testicular biopsy, testicular sperm extraction, percutaneous sperm aspiration at the time of egg retrieval)</li>
                        <li>The embryologist will inject one sperm into the center of each egg</li>
                        <li>If fertilization occurs, the healthiest embryo is placed into the female's uterine cavity</li>
                        <li>Approximately 2 weeks later, blood test is done to determine/detect pregnancy.</li><br/>

                        <li>Useful when sperm count is less</li>
                        <li>Can be used in azoospermia patients (zero sperm count). In these patients sperm is taken from testis or epididymis</li>
                        <li>Useful when sperm motility is less (very poor motility, zero motility)</li>
                        <li>Sometimes it is used for couples that have a low yield of eggs at egg retrieval. In this scenario, ICSI is being used to get a higher percentage of eggs fertilized than with conventional insemination of the eggs (mixing eggs and sperm together)</li><br/>

                        <li>It is percutaneous epidydimal sperm aspiration, is a method where sperm is collected from the epididymis inside the scrotum using a syringe and fine needle</li>
                        <li>It is often used for males with nonexistence of sperm in their ejaculation due to hindrance in the passages</li>
                        <li>There is no cut involved in this procedure. After collecting the sample, it is examined under the microscope to confirm the presence of sperm</li><br/>
                        
                        <li class="blue_title">TESA</li>
                        <li>Testicular sperm aspiration is a method where sperm is retrieved directly from the testicles with a small needle with suction applied with a small syringe and observed under microscope</li>
                        <li>The TESA method is commonly used for males with non-disruptive azoospermia condition (no sperm in semen)</li>
                        <li>If sperm is not found, a small tissue sample (testicular biopsy) is taken through a small incision in the scrotum and testis; sperm can then be extracted from the tissue</li>
                        <li>After the procedure, there may be some discomfort and bruising for a few days. Pain killers such as Paracetamol or codeine tablets can be used to abate the discomfort</li><br/>

                        <li>Then a small needle is inserted and sperm is aspirated from either the epididymis or testicle</li>
                        <li>The procedure takes approximately 30 minutes</li>
                        <li>The sperms collected are frozen and used later to fertilize female partner eggs using techniques like ICSI</li>
                        <li>Once fertilization takes place the embryo is transferred to female uterus</li><br/>
                        
                        <li class="blue_title">Advantage:</li>
                        <li>The couple can have their own genetic/ biological baby (offspring) even though sperm is absent or sperm count is less in the ejaculate</li><br/>
                        
                        <li class="blue_title">Disadvantages:</li>
                        <li>For each ICSI treatments this procedure has to be repeated as the frozen samples from previous PSEA and TSEA do not survive</li><br/>
                        
                        <li class="blue_title">Success rate:</li>
                        <li>In both cases there is a success rate of around 25% for every treatment cycle</li>

                        <li>Fertilization of egg by sperm takes place soon after its release from ovary in the fallopian tube to form single cell embryo (zygote)</li>
						<li>The zygote divides into multiple celled embryo. After 5-6 days the embryo contains many cells and is transferred to uterine cavity</li>
                        
                        <li class="blue_title">What is blastocyst</li>
                        <li>Blastocyst is the embryo that has developed five to six days after fertilization</li>
                        <li>It is the final stage of embryo before it hatches out of its shell and implants in uterine wall of female</li>
                        
                        <li class="blue_title">How is Blastocyst transfer procedure performed?</li>
                        <li>In this procedure the embryo is cultured in the laboratory incubator. The best blastocyst (one or two) are selected and implanted in female's uterus</li>
                        <li>This process is done on couples undergoing IVF or ICSI</li>
                        
                        <li class="blue_title">Advantages:</li>
                        <li>It significantly reduces the possibility of potentially dangerous high-order multiple births, such as triplets</li>
                        
                        <li class="blue_title">Disadvantages:</li>
                        <li>Some embryos will die during in the laboratory. So the number of embryos available for transfer and freezing will be less</li>
                        
                        <li class="blue_title">Success rates:</li>
                        <li>Blastocyst embryo transfers have also been associated with better IVF success rates. By allowing embryos to culture for a longer period of time, embryologists are better able to choose healthy embryos to transfer into the uterus</li>
